      "title": "Introduction to Java",
      "script": "Java is a powerful and flexible programming language that has revolutionized the world of programming. It is known for its portability, security, and ease of use, making it an ideal choice for developers of all levels. Java is used to develop robust and efficient applications, and it is used in a variety of domains, from finance to healthcare. Let's take a look at a simple Java program that prints 'Hello, World!' to the screen. This program uses the System.out.println method to print the message."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "title": "Variables and Data Types",
      "script": "Variables are the building blocks of any program. They are used to store values that can be used in the program. Java has several primitive data types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, and characters. Let's declare a variable of type int and assign it the value 10. This variable can be used in expressions and statements to perform calculations and operations."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "title": "Operators",
      "script": "Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values in Java. There are several types of operators, such as arithmetic, comparison, logical, etc. Let's use the arithmetic operator + to add two numbers. This operator takes two operands and returns their sum. Operators are essential for performing calculations and manipulating data in a program."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "title": "Control Structures",
      "script": "Control structures are used to control the flow of execution of a program. Java has several control structures, such as if-else statements, while loops, and for loops. Let's use an if-else statement to make a decision based on a condition. This statement checks the condition and executes one of two blocks of code depending on the result."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "title": "Methods",
      "script": " Methods are used to group a set of statements that can be called multiple times. Methods allow us to structure a program and reuse code. Let's define a method that adds two numbers. This method takes two parameters and returns their sum"
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "title": "Classes and Objects",
      "script": "Classes and objects are the foundation of object-oriented programming in Java. A class is a blueprint for creating objects that have properties and methods. Let's define a class Person with properties and methods. This class has a constructor that initializes the properties, and a method that prints out the person's information."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "title": "Inheritance",
      "script": "Inheritance is a mechanism that allows one class to inherit the properties and methods of another class. Let's define a class Animal with properties and methods, and a class Dog that inherits from Animal. The Dog class inherits the properties and methods of the Animal class and can also add its own properties and methods."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "title": "Interfaces",
      "script": "Interfaces are used to define contracts that must be implemented by any class that implements them. Let's define an interface Printable with a method print. Any class that implements this interface must provide an implementation for the print method."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "title": "Exceptions",
      "script": "Exceptions are used to handle errors that may occur during the execution of a program. Java has several types of exceptions, such as checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions. Let's use a try-catch block to handle an exception. This block catches any exceptions that occur during the execution of the code and provides a way to handle them."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "title": "Conclusion",
      "script": "Java is a powerful and flexible programming language that offers many features for developing robust and efficient applications. The key concepts of Java include variables, operators, control structures, methods, classes and objects, inheritance, interfaces, and exceptions. I hope this presentation has been helpful in understanding the basics of Java."
